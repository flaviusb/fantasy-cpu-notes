Different types of cores?
Throughput, streaming, responsiveness/real-timeness, dense-grid (like GPU), complex meta-DMA/device-command-stream-generator?

This uses the whole 'dark silicone' thing. Only x types of cores, of which each there are n\_i, for 0 < i < x, but only
z, which is less than the sum of x\_i for all i, may be active at once.
