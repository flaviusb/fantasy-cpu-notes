There are certain things that need to be essentially features of the universe - capabilities spread out through the entire chip, rather than set in discrete places. By providing certain parts of the service in certain places, in aggregate you end up with a service that would be impossible to provide in a centralised way.

The major examples of these things:
- The network interconnect framework.
- GC, and relatedly, memory allocation.
- Channelling.
- Nameservers/arbitrators.
- Names
- Authentication
